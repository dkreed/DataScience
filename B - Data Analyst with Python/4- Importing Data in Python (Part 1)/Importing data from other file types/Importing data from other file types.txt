Not so flat any more
In Chapter 1, you learned how to use the IPython magic command ! ls to explore your current working directory. You can also do this natively in Python using the library os, which consists of miscellaneous operating system interfaces.
The first line of the following code imports the library os, the second line stores the name of the current directory in a string called wd and the third outputs the contents of the directory in a list to the shell.
import os
wd = os.getcwd()
os.listdir(wd)
Run this code in the IPython shell and answer the following questions. Ignore the files that begin with ..
Check out the contents of your current directory and answer the following questions: (1) which file is in your directory and NOT an example of a flat file; (2) why is it not a flat file?
Instructions

Possible Answers
•	 
database.db is not a flat file because relational databases contain structured relationships and flat files do not.
•	 
battledeath.xlsx is not a flat because it is a spreadsheet consisting of many sheets, not a single table.
•	 
titanic.txt is not a flat file because it is a .txt, not a .csv.

IPython Shell

! ls
battledeath.xlsx  figure.svg  titanic_corrupt.txt  titanic.txt

Loading a pickled file
There are a number of datatypes that cannot be saved easily to flat files, such as lists and dictionaries. If you want your files to be human readable, you may want to save them as text files in a clever manner. JSONs, which you will see in a later chapter, are appropriate for Python dictionaries.
However, if you merely want to be able to import them into Python, you can serialize them. All this means is converting the object into a sequence of bytes, or a bytestream.
In this exercise, you'll import the pickle package, open a previously pickled data structure from a file and load it.
Instructions
•	Import the pickle package.
•	Complete the second argument of open() so that it is read only for a binary file. This argument will be a string of two letters, one signifying 'read only', the other 'binary'.
•	Pass the correct argument to pickle.load(); it should use the variable that is bound to open.
•	Print the data, d.
•	Print the datatype of d; take your mind back to your previous use of the function type().
Script.py

# Import pickle package
import pickle

# Open pickle file and load data
with open('data.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    d = pickle.load(file)

# Print data
print(d)

# Print datatype
print(type(d))

Listing sheets in Excel files
Whether you like it or not, any working data scientist will need to deal with Excel spreadsheets at some point in time. You won't always want to do so in Excel, however!
Here, you'll learn how to use pandas to import Excel spreadsheets and how to list the names of the sheets in any loaded .xlsx file.
Recall from the video that, given an Excel file imported into a variable spreadsheet, you can retrieve a list of the sheet names using the attribute spreadsheet.sheet_names.
Specifically, you'll be loading and checking out the spreadsheet 'battledeath.xlsx', modified from the Peace Research Institute Oslo's (PRIO) dataset. This data contains age-adjusted mortality rates due to war in various countries over several years.
Instructions
•	Assign the filename to the variable file.
•	Pass the correct argument to pd.ExcelFile() to load the file using pandas.
•	Print the sheetnames of the Excel spreadsheet by passing the necessary argument to the print() function.

Script.py
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Assign spreadsheet filename: file
file = 'battledeath.xlsx'

# Load spreadsheet: xl
xl = pd.ExcelFile(file)

# Print sheet names
print(xl.sheet_names)
IPython Shell
In [6]: # Import pandas
        import pandas as pd
        
        # Assign spreadsheet filename: file
        file = pd.ExcelFile('battledeath.xlsx')
        
        # Load spreadsheet: xl
        xl = pd.ExcelFile('battledeath.xlsx')
        
        # Print sheet names
        print('battledeath.xl.sheet_names')
battledeath.xl.sheet_names

<script.py> output:
    battledeath.xl.sheet_names
<script.py> output:
    ['2002', '2004']

Importing sheets from Excel files
In the previous exercises, you saw that the Excel file contains two sheets, '2002' and '2004'. The next step is to import these.
In this exercise, you'll learn how to import any given sheet of your loaded .xlsx file as a DataFrame. You'll be able to do so by specifying either the sheet's name or its index.
The spreadsheet 'battledeath.xlsx' is already loaded as xl.
Instructions
•	Load the sheet '2004' into the DataFrame df1 using its name as a string.
•	Print the head of df1 to the shell.
•	Load the sheet 2002 into the DataFrame df2 using its index (0).
•	Print the head of df2 to the shell.

Script.py

# Load a sheet into a DataFrame by name: df1
df1 = xl.parse('2004')

# Print the head of the DataFrame df1
print(df1.head())

# Load a sheet into a DataFrame by index: df2
df2 = xl.parse(0)

# Print the head of the DataFrame df2
print(df2.head())

Customizing your spreadsheet import
Here, you'll parse your spreadsheets and use additional arguments to skip rows, rename columns and select only particular columns.
The spreadsheet 'battledeath.xlsx' is already loaded as xl.
As before, you'll use the method parse(). This time, however, you'll add the additional arguments skiprows, names and parse_cols. These skip rows, name the columns and designate which columns to parse, respectively. All these arguments can be assigned to lists containing the specific row numbers, strings and column numbers, as appropriate.
Instructions
•	Parse the first sheet by index. In doing so, skip the first row of data and name the columns 'Country' and 'AAM due to War (2002)' using the argument names. The values passed to skiprows and names all need to be of type list.
•	Parse the second sheet by index. In doing so, parse only the first column with the parse_cols parameter, skip the first row and rename the column 'Country'. The argument passed to parse_cols also needs to be of type list.
Script.py

# Parse the first sheet and rename the columns: df1
df1 = xl.parse(0, skiprows=[0], names=['Country', 'AAM due to War (2002)'])

# Print the head of the DataFrame df1
print(df1.head())

# Parse the first column of the second sheet and rename the column: df2
df2 = xl.parse(1, parse_cols=[0], skiprows=[0], names=['Country'])

# Print the head of the DataFrame df2
print(df2.head())

Using File to import HDF5 files
The h5py package has been imported in the environment and the file LIGO_data.hdf5 is loaded in the object h5py_file.
What is the correct way of using the h5py function, File(), to import the file in h5py_file into an object, h5py_data, for reading only?
Instructions
Possible Answers
•	 
h5py_data = File(h5py_file, 'r')
•	 
h5py_data = h5py.File(h5py_file, 'r')
•	 
h5py_data = h5py.File(h5py_file, read)
•	 
h5py_data = h5py.File(h5py_file, 'read')

Using h5py to import HDF5 files
The file 'LIGO_data.hdf5' is already in your working directory. In this exercise, you'll import it using the h5py library. You'll also print out its datatype to confirm you have imported it correctly. You'll then study the structure of the file in order to see precisely what HDF groups it contains.
You can find the LIGO data plus loads of documentation and tutorials here. There is also a great tutorial on Signal Processing with the data here.
Instructions
•	Import the package h5py.
•	Assign the name of the file to the variable file.
•	Load the file as read only into the variable data.
•	Print the datatype of data.
•	Print the names of the groups in the HDF5 file 'LIGO_data.hdf5'

Script.py

# Import packages
import numpy as np
import h5py

# Assign filename: file
file = 'LIGO_data.hdf5'

# Load file: data
data = h5py.File(file, 'r')

# Print the datatype of the loaded file
print(type(data))

# Print the keys of the file
for key in data.keys():
    print(key)

Extracting data from your HDF5 file
In this exercise, you'll extract some of the LIGO experiment's actual data from the HDF5 file and you'll visualize it.
To do so, you'll need to first explore the HDF5 group 'strain'.
Instructions
•	Assign the HDF5 group data['strain'] to group.
•	In the for loop, print out the keys of the HDF5 group in group.
•	Assign to the variable strain the values of the time series data data['strain']['Strain'] using the attribute .value.
•	Set num_samples equal to 10000, the number of time points we wish to sample.
•	Execute the rest of the code to produce a plot of the time series data in LIGO_data.hdf5.

Script.py

# Get the HDF5 group: group
group = data['strain']

# Check out keys of group
for key in group.keys():
    print(key)

# Set variable equal to time series data: strain
strain = data['strain']['Strain'].value

# Set number of time points to sample: num_Samples
num_samples = 10000

# Set time vector
time = np.arange(0, 1, 1/num_samples)

# Plot data
plt.plot(time, strain[:num_samples])
plt.xlabel('GPS Time (s)')

Loading .mat files
In this exercise, you'll figure out how to load a MATLAB file using scipy.io.loadmat() and you'll discover what Python datatype it yields.
The file 'albeck_gene_expression.mat' is in your working directory. This file contains gene expression data from the Albeck Lab at UC Davis. You can find the data and some great documentation here.
Instructions
•	Import the package scipy.io.
•	Load the file 'albeck_gene_expression.mat' into the variable mat; do so using the function scipy.io.loadmat().
•	Use the function type() to print the datatype of mat to the IPython shell.

Script.py

# Import package
import scipy.io

# Load MATLAB file: mat
mat = scipy.io.loadmat('albeck_gene_expression.mat')

# Print the datatype type of mat
print(type(mat))

The structure of .mat in Python
Here, you'll discover what is in the MATLAB dictionary that you loaded in the previous exercise.
The file 'albeck_gene_expression.mat' is already loaded into the variable mat. The following libraries have already been imported as follows:
import scipy.io
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
Once again, this file contains gene expression data from the Albeck Lab at UCDavis. You can find the data and some great documentation here.
Instructions
•	Use the method .keys() on the dictionary mat to print the keys. Most of these keys (in fact the ones that do NOT begin and end with '__') are variables from the corresponding MATLAB environment.
•	Print the type of the value corresponding to the key 'CYratioCyt' in mat. Recall that mat['CYratioCyt'] accesses the value.
•	Print the shape of the value corresponding to the key 'CYratioCyt' using the numpy function shape().
•	Execute the entire script to see some oscillatory gene expression data!



Script.py

# Print the keys of the MATLAB dictionary
print(mat.keys())

# Print the type of the value corresponding to the key 'CYratioCyt'
print(type(mat['CYratioCyt']))

# Print the shape of the value corresponding to the key 'CYratioCyt'
print(np.shape(mat['CYratioCyt']))

# Subset the array and plot it
data = mat['CYratioCyt'][25, 5:]
