Loading and exploring a JSON
Now that you know what a JSON is, you'll load one into your Python environment and explore it yourself. Here, you'll load the JSON 'a_movie.json' into the variable json_data, which will be a dictionary. You'll then explore the JSON contents by printing the key-value pairs of json_data to the shell.
Instructions
•	Load the JSON 'a_movie.json' into the variable json_data within the context provided by the with statement. To do so, use the function json.load() within the context manager.
•	Use a for loop to print all key-value pairs in the dictionary json_data. Recall that you can access a value in a dictionary using the syntax: dictionary[key].
Scritp.py
# Load JSON: json_data
with open("a_movie.json") as json_file:
    json_data = json.load(json_file)

# Print each key-value pair in json_data
for k in json_data.keys():
    print(k + ': ', json_data[k])

Print the values corresponding to the keys 'Title' and 'Year' and answer the following question about the movie that the JSON describes:

API requests
Now it's your turn to pull some movie data down from the Open Movie Database (OMDB) using their API. The movie you'll query the API about is The Social Network. Recall that, in the video, to query the API about the movie Hackers, Hugo's query string was 'http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=hackers'and had a single argument t=hackers.
Note: recently, OMDB has changed their API: you now also have to specify an API key. This means you'll have to add another argument to the URL: apikey=72bc447a.
Instructions
•	Import the requests package.
•	Assign to the variable url the URL of interest in order to query 'http://www.omdbapi.com' for the data corresponding to the movie The Social Network. The query string should have two arguments: apikey=72bc447a and t=the+social+network. You can combine them as follows: apikey=72bc447a&t=the+social+network.
•	Print the text of the reponse object r by using its text attribute and passing the result to the print() function.

Scritp.py

# Import requests package
import requests

# Assign URL to variable: url
url = 'http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=72bc447a&t=the+social+network' 

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)



# Print the text of the response
print(r.text)

JSON–from the web to Python
Wow, congrats! You've just queried your first API programmatically in Python and printed the text of the response to the shell. However, as you know, your response is actually a JSON, so you can do one step better and decode the JSON. You can then print the key-value pairs of the resulting dictionary. That's what you're going to do now!
Instructions
•	Pass the variable url to the requests.get() function in order to send the relevant request and catch the response, assigning the resultant response message to the variable r.
•	Apply the json() method to the response object r and store the resulting dictionary in the variable json_data.
•	Hit Submit Answer to print the key-value pairs of the dictionary json_data to the shell.

Scritp.py

# Import package
import requests

# Assign URL to variable: url
url = 'http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=72bc447a&t=social+network'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Decode the JSON data into a dictionary: json_data
json_data = r.json()

# Print each key-value pair in json_data
for k in json_data.keys():
    print(k + ': ', json_data[k])

Checking out the Wikipedia API
You're doing so well and having so much fun that we're going to throw one more API at you: the Wikipedia API (documented here). You'll figure out how to find and extract information from the Wikipedia page for Pizza. What gets a bit wild here is that your query will return nested JSONs, that is, JSONs with JSONs, but Python can handle that because it will translate them into dictionaries within dictionaries.
The URL that requests the relevant query from the Wikipedia API is
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&format=json&exintro=&titles=pizza
Instructions
•	Assign the relevant URL to the variable url.
•	Apply the json() method to the response object r and store the resulting dictionary in the variable json_data.
•	The variable pizza_extract holds the HTML of an extract from Wikipedia's Pizza page as a string; use the function print() to print this string to the shell.

Scritp.py

# Import package
import requests

# Assign URL to variable: url
url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&format=json&exintro=&titles=pizza'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Decode the JSON data into a dictionary: json_data
json_data = r.json()

# Print the Wikipedia page extract
pizza_extract = json_data['query']['pages']['24768']['extract']
print(pizza_extract)

    <p><b>Pizza</b> (<small>Italian: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈpittsa]</span>, <small>Neapolitan: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈpittsə]</span>) is a savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and various other ingredients (anchovies, olives, meat, etc.) baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a  wood-fired oven. In formal settings, like a restaurant, pizza is  eaten with knife and fork, but in casual settings it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand. Small pizzas are sometimes called pizzettas.
    </p><p>The term <i>pizza</i> was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries. It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe and North America, available at  pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza),  restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and via pizza delivery. Many companies sell ready-baked frozen pizzas to be reheated in an ordinary home oven.
    </p><p>The <i>Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana</i> (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is  a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza. In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish, and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.</p>
